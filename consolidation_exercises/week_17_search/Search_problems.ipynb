    "In last week's class, we saw how to implement some abstract data types (e.g. stacks and trees). Many real-world problems can be solved by first describing them as a tree (or graph) and then searching for a path between the nodes on the tree. In today's consolidation exercise, look at implementing and using algorithms for searching through a data structure. Before we do that, we'll have a quick refresher on classes as we implement two additional data structures that we'll need. \n",

    "A *queue* is very similar to a stack- it's a collection of elements, with push and pop operations. The only difference is that rather than using the principle of Last-In, First-Out, a queue uses First-In, First-Out (FIFO). We can implement this in Python with almost the same code as for the stack- the only thing we need to change is how the pop operation works. Rather than popping the last element, we need to pop the first element. Fortunately, Python's built in list pop method can take an argument, specifying which index should be popped. If we call, my_list.pop(0), it'll remove and return the first element of the list for us. \n",

    "The final abstract data structure we'll look at today is a graph. A graph $G = (V, E)$ consists of a set of vertices, $V$, connected by a set of edges $E$. Each vertex in a graph is associated with a particular value- i.e for the image below, node 1 has a value of 3. Edges in a graph may be undirected (if node i is connected to j, then j is also connected to i), or directed (node i can be connected to node j, but node j may not be connected to node i). Edges may optionally be associated with a weight or cost. We can use graphs to represent the relationships between a set of objects. e.g. to represent whether Alice and Bob know each other, whether we can travel from Park street to University row directly (or not), or whether a gene A increases activation of gene B. While Trees can also be used to represent relationships like this, the restrictions placed on trees (i.e you always have to have a root node), mean that some sets of relationships are best described with a graph. \n",

For example, we could represent the nodes in the image with a list:"

    "One type of problem that we can solve with search (but not a binary search tree) is finding the shorted path between two locations. For example, we can use a search algorithm to find the shortest path between any two regions in Bristol. The basic idea is to start at the origin location and then check whether any of its children are the destination- if they are, great, we've found the shortest path. If not, we then check the to see if any of its children's children are the destination. If not, we continue checking children's children's children and so on, until we find the destination. \n",
    "\n",
    "A similar approach can also be used to decide on the best move in deterministic games like chess or tic-tac-toe. To represent a game with a tree like this, we use the current state of the game as the root node in our tree. Each of our possible moves then represents the children of the root. For each of those children, we can then add further children representing a possible move by our opponent. We can then win the game by searching for a sequence of moves that leads to victory. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll see how this works by writing some code to find the shortest path between Cotham and Westbury. We'll use the approach described above- checking the children of the start node, and then the children's children until we find the destination. This approach is known as *Breadth first search* as it explores the search tree by always checking the nodes closest (in the tree) to the starting node. To do this, we'll need to to keep track of which nodes we need to check next, and which nodes we've already visited. We can do this using a Queue. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start by adding our start node (Cotham) to the queue and initalising an empty list to represent the nodes we've already visited."

This is due to the way it explores the search tree, always checking first the node which is closest to the root of the search tree. An alternative to breadth-first-search is depth-first-search (DFS), in which we instead look at the node which is *furthest* from the root of the search tree. We can switch between breadth and depth first search just by changing our data structure from a queue (for BFS) to a stack (for DFS). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise** Add some code to your solution for counting how many nodes of the graph are explored before a solution is found. Now change your BFS code into DFS (by using a stack instead of a queue). How does the number of nodes explored change as you swap between BFS and DFS?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although BFS and DFS will both work for these sorts of problems, we can in general do better. The key idea is that rather than just relying on information about how close we are to the root node to order our search path, we can also use information about the distance from the goal. In the case of path planning, we can calculate the euclidean distance between a node and the goal, and explore nodes with a lower distance to the goal first.\n",

    "**Task 5**: Extend your solution to task 3 to use a priority queue. You will need to first implement a class representing a priority queue. You have two choices for how you go about this- you can either modify the pop method, to first search for the highest priority item. Or, you can modify the push method to keep the queue sorted as new items are added. Once you've implemented your PriorityQueue class, you'll need to write a function to calculate the priority of each neighbour of a grid (by calculating the distance from a node to the goal), and then switch from a Queue to a PriorityQueue in your search algorithm.
