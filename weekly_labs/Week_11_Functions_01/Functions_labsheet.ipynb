    "\n",
    "To define a function we use the *def* keyword, followed by the name of the function, some brackets (empty for now) and finally a colon (:). The lines of code that we want to be executed when we *call* the function are then written on the lines below (and indented one level). For example, a function to print a message could be written as follows:\n"

Another file contains a listing of the student name associated with each id. To solve this problem, I wrote the code below.

    "Personally, I think recursive functions are harder to reason about than non-recursive functions, so my rule of thumb is to use a non-recursive function if I can. However, if a problem has something that feels naturally recursive (i.e it maps nicely to the base case / recursive case pattern), then I'd prefer recursion. In practice, there are a relatively small number of (often quite important) problems that naturally map this way. We'll see one of these (searching) later in the course."

    "   \n",
    "2. Given a list of data, we often want to know if a certain value is contained in the list. A naive solution to this problem loops through the entire list, checking to see if each element is a match. If the list of data is ordered, then we can do better than this- rather than checking every value, we start by checking the middle value. If this is a match, we're done. If the middle value is less than the value we're looking for, then we search only the first-half of the list. If the middle value is greater, then we search the second-half instead. This sort of search algorithm is known as *binary* search, because we're splitting the list into two at each level. Write a function to implement binary search for integers. It should take a list of integers and a target as inputs and return True if and only if the target is in the list. Otherwise, it should return False.\n",

    "4. A palindrome is a word or phrase which reads the same forward as it does backwards- i.e \"level\" and \"nurses run\" are both palindromes. Write a recursive function which takes a string as input and returns True if and only if the string is a palindrome.\n"
