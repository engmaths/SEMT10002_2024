    "We have already seen how we can use functions to improve the correctness and readability of our code. Another tool that we can use to improve the readability of our code (in some cases), is the ability to define *classes*. Defining a class allows us to group variables (often call attributes) and functions (typically called methods) together. In problems where there is a natural grouping like this, this approach can be a powerful and helpful tool. Writing code in this way is often called Object-orientated programming or OOP.\n",

For me, OOP starts to make sense when there is a natural grouping of variables together *and* I'm likely to need many of these \"groups\". For example, if I wanted to simulate a swarm of 100 robots, then I think the OOP approach would make a lot more sense than imperative- the imperative code could still work, but I think it would take much longer to write and be more prone to errors. If I only wanted to simulate one robot, I'm not sure it would be worth the effort of defining a class. \n",

We've also seen some of Python's other built-in data structures, like *set*, which is like a list, but does not allow duplicate values, or the *dict*, in which each value is associated with a *key*, rather than an *index*, and a numpy *array*, in which all data must be of the same type (i.e all floats, or all 16 bit integers). \n",

If we're writing an algorithm that requires us to repeatedly check whether a value is in a data structure, it'll run much quicker if we use a dictionary rather than a list. "

    "Before your code is executed, the Python interpreter will check to see whether your code only contains balanced parantheses. It'll do this, by using a stack. The basic idea is to go through the string, a character as a time. Each time we come across an opening bracket, we add it to our stack. Each time we come across a closing bracket, we pop the top item off of our stack and check to see if it matches the closing bracket. If it doesn't, then we have unbalanced parantheses. If we go through the entire string, without finding any mismatched parentheses, *and* the stack is empty, then our string has balanced parantheses. \n",

Trees are a common data structure- probably you are most familiar with a tree structure from the file directory used to organise the files and folders on most computers. A *tree* is used to represent a set of nodes that are connected in some kind of heirarchical relationship. Each node can be connected to many *children*, but only one *parent*, except for the root node, which has no parent. In the image above, the root node is shown in red.

    "This code is correct and fairly readable, but for a list of length N, will take on average N operations to execute- i.e it's O(N) or linear time.

If it's greater than the current node, we only need to check the subtree on the right. On average, this means our search will only take log(N) operations. \n",

    "The code stub below partially defines a class for a binary search tree. We've provided you with an initialisation method, and an insert method. However, the search method hasn't been implemented. This method should check whether a value is in the tree, returning ```True``` if it is and ```False``` if it isn't. A good way to approach this is by using recursion- if the value of the current node matches the value you are searching for, then you return ```True```. If not, then you need to look at either the left or right child- If the value you are looking for is less than the current node, you would check the left child. If the left child doesn't exist, then return ```False```. If it does, then you should return whatever result you get from calling the search method on the left-hand tree.\n",
