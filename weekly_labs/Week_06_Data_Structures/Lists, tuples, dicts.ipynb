    "## Comprehension Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "The Powerpoint file \"comprehension checks.ppt\" has a number of short code samples for you to review. If you have understood everything in the pre-watch videos, then you should be able to tell what the output of these blocks of code are *without* running them. In pairs, discuss what you think the output is and then check your answer by running the code yourself (all samples are available in comprehension_checks.py). Note you'll need to use comments to control which parts of the code run. If you get all questions correct, then I would suggest you skip the text of the worksheet (as it covers the same material as the videos) and go straight into the exercises. If you get something wrong, please ask your TA to explain it to you, or use menti.com code: 6184 155 to ask for further explanation from myself. Or in pseudo_python code:\n",

    "If we want a second robot, we could create some more variables- ```robot_name_2 = \"Hemma\"```, ```robot_name_3 = \"Arthur\"```. This is fine when we have small amounts of each variable- but what if we want to create and name 100 robots? \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, Python has built-in data types for working with *sequences* of data, including *list*, *set*, *tuple* and *dictionary*. We'll look at each of these today, starting with the list."
