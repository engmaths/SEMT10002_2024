    "For many of you, this will be your first exposure to programming. It's our strong belief that every person on this course is fully able to become a confident and capable programmer. However, programming (and especially learning to program) can also be incredibly frustrating- often our code won't work and sometimes we'll get confusing error messages or see syntax we don't understand. This can then be compounded by the fact that some of our peers may not seem to be struggling at all (i.e someone may have done A level Computing, or self-taught themselves as a hobby). Unfortunately, every year, we see students decide that programming \"just isn't for them\". While we don't need everybody here to love programming, to access many of the modules in the later years of your course, you will be expected to be able to write code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also remember that computing is a huge subject and by necessity we've had to skip over many details to focus on the core things you need in this course. This means it's completely normal to occasionally feel unsure or frustrated about something. With time, and practice, this will turn into confident and capability. But if you do find yourself struggling like this, please don't suffer in silence! Talk to us, your peers or your TA.  "

    "# Getting started with the terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have your Terminal installed and setup, let's see what you can do with it. Start by opening a Terminal. You should see a screen like the image below (Mac and Linux users may appear slightly different):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/engmaths/SEMT10002_2024/blob/main/img/BlankTerminal.png?raw=true\" width=\"60%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The $ symbol here is the bash prompt, indicating that you can enter bash commands. When you first open a terminal, it will by default open looking at a specific directory. You can find out which directory you are in by typing *pwd*, which stands for \"print working directory\". You can also see the contents of the directory you are in by typing *ls*. The image below shows what happens when I type these commands on my machine- as your files and folders are different to mine, your output will also be slightly different. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/engmaths/SEMT10002_2024/blob/main/img/TerminalImage2.png?raw=true\" width=\"60%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you compare the list we get from terminal, to the files shown in File Explorer you should see they are the same- as explained above, the terminal is a text-based interface, that allows us to do many of the same (and more!) tasks we can do with a graphical user interface. To start navigating the file system with the terminal, we can use the command *cd \\<name of folder>* (which stands for change directory). For example, if I want to see what's in the *Lab* folder, I would type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ cd Lab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, it might feel like using the terminal to navigate the file system is much slower than with a GUI (so much typing!). A few things that can speed up file system navigation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bash uses \"..\" to represent the directory that contains the one I am currently in. If I wanted to return from the **Lab** folder to the previous folder, I can just type **cd ..**\n",
    "2. Bash has \"Tab autocompletion\". Rather than typing the entire name of the directory I want to enter, I can simply type the first letter and then hit the *Tab* key on my keyboard. If the directory I want is the only option with that letter, Bash will autocomplete the path for me. \n",
    "3. You can cycle through old commands by pressing the up arrow. Hitting enter will then run the previous command. To see a list of previously entered commands, you can type history and then hit enter. This will give you a list of previous commands with a number next to them. e.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ history\n",
    "  121 rm some_rubbish.txt\n",
    "  122 cd homework_solutions P\n",
    "  123 ls\n",
    "  124 cd engmaths/week13\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Typing !122 and hitting enter will run \"cd homework_solutions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4> Basic Terminal commands </h4>\n",
    "We have already seen 3 examples of terminal commands. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *ls*  (list) - lists the contents of a directory\n",
    "2. *pwd* (print working directory) - prints the name of the current directory you are in\n",
    "3. *cd \\<name of directory\\>* (change directory) - navigates to a new directory\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now introduce some further commands that will allow you to manipulate the files on your computer. Note that I'm using angle brackets *\\<>* to show where a command requires a parameter, and curly brackets *()* to give the name of the command. Some further useful Bash commands are:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *mkdir \\<name of directory\\>* (make directory) - makes a new directory\n",
    "5. *touch \\<name of file\\>* (touch) - makes a new (empty) file\n",
    "6. *cp \\<source file\\> \\<destination file\\>* (copy) - copies a file from source to destination\n",
    "7. *mv \\<source file\\> \\<destination file\\>* (move) - moves a file from source to destination\n",
    "8. *rm \\<name of file\\>* (remove) - deletes a file\n",
    "9. *cat \\<name of file\\>* (concatenate) - displays the contents of a file\n",
    "10. *rmdir \\<name of directory\\>* (remove directory) - deletes a directory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:** Using these commands, make a new directory called \"CPA\", with a subdirectory called \"Week 1\" inside it. Inside \"Block 1\", create an empty file called \"Exercise 1.py\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:** Now create a second directory inside your CPA folder called \"Week 2\". Copy the file \"Exercise 1.py\" from the folder \"Week 1\" into folder \"Week 2\". Now delete the original file from \"Block 1\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When completing this exercise, you may had had some issues when using \"cd\" as the directory names have a space in them. This is because the cd command interprets a string containing a space as two separate strings. You can get around this by using quotation marks, e.g. ```cd \"Week 1\"```. However, it's good practice to avoid using spaces in the directory names- using a dash(-) or an underscore(\\_) to represent spaces instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:** Delete the two directories, and file, then make a new directory \"Week_1\", and make a new file inside it called \"Exercise_1.py\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the commands we have introduced can be modified by the addition of one or more *flags*. For example, if we type ```rm -i \\<name of file>``` then we will be prompted prior to the deletion of each file. To find out more about the various options available for these commands, you can usually type the name of the command followed by --help. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h4> Running code through the terminal </h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "A terminal not only allows us to use the built-in commands that we have seen, but also lets us run code that we have written.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:** Open the text file you previously created (\"Exercise1.py\") and type in the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the file (in the directory \"CPA/Block_1\"), and then run it through the terminal by typing \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 Exercise1.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:** Check that you have correctly installed all the necessary software for this course by typing in and running the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#Import the numpy library\n",
    "import numpy as np \n",
    "#Import the matplotlib library\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt \n",
    "\n",
    "xs = np.linspace(0, 100)\n",
    "ys = np.sin(xs)\n",
    "plt.plot(xs, ys)\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've finished all of these exercises, please help other members of your study group for the remainder of the session. If everybody in your group has finished, please feel free to leave early! \n"
